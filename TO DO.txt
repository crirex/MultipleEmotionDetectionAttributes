- GUI App
    - general clean up
    - get rid of anything that's not used

- For Video
    - change layout of showing the emotions
    - show if the user has eyeglasses (currently it's typing in the console)
    - show if the user has eyes closed/opened
    - refactor + break the run() method in multiple smaller functions
    - the first prediction/camera open takes to long -> fix it !
    - record all the major actions -> state, eyes, glasses and store them for statistics
    
- For Audio
    - Add microphone plotting
    - Record data until the user presses cancel/stop
    - Show in real time emotions after 3 seconds of usage 
        or show them all the statistics area in tabelar form + export csv 
    -
    
- For Text ?????
    - Investigate how it works
    - implement it
    - after the user typed or while is typeing, show emotions or show them in the statistics area
    

- Statistics
    - different plots for the features (camera, audio, text) - histograms, pies, wiskers, diagrams etc
    - some correlations ?? see hoe much of each emotion correlate
        ex. Camera happy and text/audio sad -> something wrong!
    - export them in csv or png for the plots (or other form)
    
Maybe to add:
- Settings
    - activate/inactivate features
    - select audio/video device
    - user login - in order to keep data associated with somebody 
    - store data (sql, nosql, files)
    - random screenshots of the app ??
